# Tinker: Natural Language Processing Toolkit in Javascript  

## Purpose

To provide a comprehensive JavaScript library for natural language processing tasks, empowering developers to build intelligent applications.

## Key Functions

- Text Preprocessing: Normalization, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization, and cleaning.
- Tokenization: Word, sentence, and subword tokenization.
- POS Tagging: Assigning parts of speech to words.
- Named Entity Recognition: Identifying entities like names, places, dates.
- Sentiment Analysis: Detecting positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
- Text Classification: Classifying text into predefined categories.
- Word Embeddings: Using Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT for semantic understanding.
- Language Models: n-grams, RNNs, transformers (BERT, GPT).
- Text Similarity: Measuring similarity between text snippets.
- Spell Checking & Autocorrect: Basic correction and autocompletion.
- Language Detection: Identifying the language of a given text.
- Parsing & Syntax Trees: Creating dependency trees for sentence structure.
- Text Summarization: Extractive and (optionally) abstractive summarization.
- Question Answering (QA): Answering questions based on a given text corpus.
- Coreference Resolution: Linking pronouns to their referents.
- Machine Translation (Optional): Basic translation using seq2seq models or APIs.

## Benefits for You as a Developer

1. Efficiency: Save time and effort by using a pre-built library instead of implementing everything from scratch.
2. Flexibility: Customize the toolkit to fit your specific needs and projects.
3. Accuracy: Benefit from the power of advanced algorithms and models for accurate NLP results.
4. Ease of Use: The user-friendly API makes it easy to integrate the toolkit into your applications.
5. Community Support: Access a growing community of developers for help, collaboration, and sharing knowledge.
6. Extensibility: Contribute to the project by adding new features or improving existing ones.
7. Integration: Easily integrate the toolkit with other JavaScript libraries and frameworks.
8. Learning Resource: Use the toolkit as a learning tool to explore NLP concepts and techniques (this is mostly for me)
