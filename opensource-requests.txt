This is a list of things the project needs as I encounter them:

- lib/stopwords: a list of stopwords in other languages such as arabic, french... 
- TextProcessor.js: language processing for other languages
- TextProcessor.js: expandContractions returns variations of the words that has multiple expansions (/)
